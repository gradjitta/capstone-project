Steps in Completing Your Project

- Step 1: Propose and Scope the Project

  - The project deploys an app to the AWS Kubernetes Cluster 
  - Used Jenkins for the CICD pipeline
  - Deployment type Chosen: Rolling deployment
  - Used Docker Hub for pulling the images
  - Build a minimal streamlit app for Text processing

- Step 2: Use Jenkins, and implement blue/green or rolling deployment.
  - [x] Create your Jenkins master box with either Jenkins and install the plugins you will need.
  - [x] Set up your environment to which you will deploy code.
  
- Step 3: Pick AWS Kubernetes as a Service, or build your own Kubernetes cluster.
  - [x] Used CloudFormation to build the infrastructure
  - [x] The Kubernetes cluster initialization with Cloudformation

- Step 4: Build your pipeline
  - [x] Construct your pipeline in your GitHub repository.
  - [x] Set up all the steps that your pipeline will include.
  - [x] Configure a deployment pipeline.
  - [x] Include your Dockerfile/source code in the Git repository.
  - [x] Include with your Linting step both a failed Linting screenshot and a successful Linting screenshot to show the Linter working properly.
  
- Step 5: Test your pipeline
  - [x] Perform builds on your pipeline.
  - [x] Verify that your pipeline works as you designed it.
  - [x] Take a screenshot of the Jenkins pipeline showing deployment and a screenshot of your AWS EC2 page showing the newly modified (for rolling) instances.
